          Issue  When encountering this issue the computer will start using the CPU to it&#39;s maximum potential which will make the fans noisy and therefore the computer usage experience terrible.
  Solution  To fix this issue you could either run balooctl disable and later remove the indexing file, created by baloo_file_index, or you could edit ~/.config/baloofilerc and append the following lines to the end of the configuration file:

          Getting Started  Are you a Chinese speaking person? A person planning on learning Chinese digitally? Did you download Fcitx and set it up to the point that you started the download for the package fcitx-sogoupinyin but ended up in an endless loop where you started wondering whether there was an endless reoccurring loop of errors but didn&#39;t believe your gut feelings?
 Well, I am here to confirm what you are feeling and of course, this is not the ultimate solution to the problem because what you might be facing could be something totally different than the problem I had which was an endless loop of building Qtwebkit, which is a package that is needed for fcitx-sogoupinyin to be installed.

          LeagueClient.exe could not be found!  This tutorial is written for Arch Linux users and should be followed with caution!
Getting Started  Using Arch Linux as your first distro can be painful sometimes, especially when you don&#39;t know your way around the system. You can get lost, depressed and even want to through your PC/Laptop from the 8 floor to make sure it doesn&#39;t survive. Although you can reach this certain point, you sure wouldn&#39;t commit suicide after having a Windows 10 update running for 1 day making all your work delayed!

          First and Foremost…  I am not responsible over whatever shit that might occur during your migration process. What I am doing in this guide is documenting the process of the migration for my two previous partitions into one unified partition for the sake of seeking this guide when required.
  Getting Started  Have you ever gotten into a situation where you have to clean your /root partitions cache constantly because it keeps getting full?

          Cause?  Weird Power-saving mode enabled by default, which causes Fn-key to not disable light after being disabled + random network disconnection + bluetooth not enabling after being disabled although rfkill list shows no presence of soft kill.
  Temporary Solution:  su -c &#39;ip link set wlp3s0 down &amp;&amp; modprobe -r rtw88_8822be &amp;&amp; modprobe rtw88_8822be &amp;&amp; ip link set wlp3s0 up&#39;    Permantent Solution - Dante777  Append one of the following in the kernel parameters of your bootloader of choice:

  Installing Packagesnew  Install the packages required by your new Desktop Environemnt (DE) of choice you want to replace Deepin with, which in this case is KDE Plasma:
