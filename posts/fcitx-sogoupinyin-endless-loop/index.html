<p>Are you a Chinese speaking person? A person planning on learning Chinese digitally? Did you download Fcitx and set it up to the point that you started the download for the package fcitx-sogoupinyin but ended up in an endless loop where you started wondering whether there was an endless reoccurring loop of errors but didn&#39;t believe your gut feelings?</p>
<p>
Well, I am here to confirm what you are feeling and of course, this is not the ultimate solution to the problem because what you might be facing could be something totally different than the problem I had which was an endless loop of building Qtwebkit, which is a package that is needed for fcitx-sogoupinyin to be installed.</p>
<p>
The solution to the problem is very simple and goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Cancel the current running installation for fcitx-sogoupinyin by clicking on <code>CTRL + C</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install Qtwebkit-bin package from AUR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reinstall fcitx-sogoupinyin.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That should solve the problem for you! Hope you enjoy your time learning/using the package :)</p>
