          Introduction  Ever wanted to remove the pre-installed applications that came with your phone? Fortunately, there is an easy way to debloat your phone by uninstalling the unnecessary applications installed on your phone rather than disabling them (as suggested by the application manager of your phone).
  Method    Append programs.adb.enable = true; to your configuration.nix for your NixOS dotfiles.
  Or install the package through your distro&#39;s package manager.

          Wireguard.nix  One of the many free &amp; open-source VPN protocol and when fused with the wonderful declarative Nix configuration one is able to setup their system without hinders!
 In this post I will attempt to explain how to setup a declarative wireguard.nix module, enjoy!
 Note: The &lt;&lt;X&gt;&gt; provided in the source-blocks links the remaining source blocks with the source-block they are input in. This is useful when writing your Nix configurations in org-mode and later tangling (outputs the code only) the result to a example.

          Introduction  The process of installing extensions for your gnome-shell is not as simple as installing addons from your browser store. One has to first install a package by the name of GNOME Shell-integration from the browser store and also chrome-gnome-shell to enable Gnome-extension to install, remove and configure the installed Gnome extensions.
  Procedure  To enable the installation of Gnome extension on the Firefox browser installed from nixpkgs we are required to add chrome-gnome-shell to our installed packages in environment.

          Issue  When encountering this issue the computer will start using the CPU to it&#39;s maximum potential which will make the fans noisy and therefore the computer usage experience terrible.
  Solution  To fix this issue you could either run balooctl disable and later remove the indexing file, created by baloo_file_index, or you could edit ~/.config/baloofilerc and append the following lines to the end of the configuration file:

          Getting Started  Are you a Chinese speaking person? A person planning on learning Chinese digitally? Did you download Fcitx and set it up to the point that you started the download for the package fcitx-sogoupinyin but ended up in an endless loop where you started wondering whether there was an endless reoccurring loop of errors but didn&#39;t believe your gut feelings?
 Well, I am here to confirm what you are feeling and of course, this is not the ultimate solution to the problem because what you might be facing could be something totally different than the problem I had which was an endless loop of building Qtwebkit, which is a package that is needed for fcitx-sogoupinyin to be installed.

Getting Started  Using Arch Linux as your first distro can be painful sometimes, especially when you don&#39;t know your way around the system. You can get lost, depressed and even want to through your PC/Laptop from the 8 floor to make sure it doesn&#39;t survive. Although you can reach this certain point, you sure wouldn&#39;t commit suicide after having a Windows 10 update running for 1 day making all your work delayed!

What I am doing in this guide is documenting the process of the migration for my two previous partitions into one unified partition for the sake of seeking this guide when required.
